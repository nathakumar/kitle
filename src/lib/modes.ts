const BASE_BUILD_RULES = `STRICT RULES:
- Always return a COMPLETE working project via the emit_project tool. Never reply in prose.
- Required files: "/index.html", "/index.tsx" (entry), "/App.tsx", "/styles.css".
- Use plain CSS in /styles.css. Do NOT use Tailwind, shadcn, or any external UI library.
- Only standard dependencies: react, react-dom. Do NOT import other npm packages.
- /index.tsx must mount <App /> into #root using react-dom/client createRoot.
- /index.html must contain <div id="root"></div> and <script type="module" src="/index.tsx"></script>.
- Code must be production-quality, fully typed, and runnable with NO additional setup.
- Use relative imports like "./components/Header" — never "@/..." aliases.
- Return the FULL set of files every time. When editing currentFiles, preserve untouched files.`;

${BASE_BUILD_RULES}

QUALITY BAR:
- Build a REAL product: multiple meaningful screens, real interactions, realistic seed data, empty/loading/hover states.
- Modern beautiful design: thoughtful typography, generous spacing, soft shadows, rounded corners, coherent palette via CSS variables, dark-mode-friendly, fully responsive, micro-interactions.
- Sticky nav + hero/dashboard header + footer when relevant.
- Semantic HTML and accessible labels.

STRUCTURE:
- Split into many focused files under /components/, /pages/, /hooks/, /lib/, /data/, /types.ts.
- Aim for 12-25 small single-purpose files.

The "summary" field is a 1-2 sentence human description of what changed or was built.`,

1. **Executive Summary** — 2-3 sentences.

4. **Charts** — render small ASCII / unicode bar charts in code fences, plus markdown tables for distributions.
5. **Recommendations** — prioritized action items.
6. **Methodology & Caveats** — short note on assumptions.

Use clean markdown (headings, lists, tables, code fences). Be concrete and quantitative. If the user did not supply data, generate realistic seed data and clearly label it as illustrative.`,
